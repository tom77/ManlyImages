# Wyndham Images Prototype

This interface was created by Mitchell Whitelaw as a part of a research project funded by the State Library of New South Wales and supported by the Manly Library. It uses collection data from the National Library of Australia's Trove API. 

The interface is being adapted to display content from the Wyndham History archive (wyndhamhistory.net.au)

For more information about the original project, see http://creative.canberra.edu.au/mitchell/ManlyImages/
